# OsmMarkers
Several websites allow to place a marker on OpenStreetMap. When it comes to displaying several markers with different properties it's getting more complicated.
This scripts uses an excel file as input to display any number of markers on a map. Output is a png file

Excel file contains:
- Marker data (coordinates, color, size,...)
- Text annotations
- Map boundaries
